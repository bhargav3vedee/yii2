You can Define relation in either base Model or in model.

Define relation in function relationNames()

public function relationNames()
{
	return ['demo'];
}

then, make function of defined relation's. Remember function name of relation must contain "get" keyword.

public function getDemo()
{
	return $this->hasMany(Demo::className(), ['field of Demo which contains id of this table', 'field of this table'];
}

Here, first argument should be field name of parent class whose "id" used by this table.
and second argument should be "field name of this table".

then, in search class model join this relation name with query.

$query->joinWith('demo');

and use query for filter.

andFilterWhere('like', demo.name, $this->demoid);
